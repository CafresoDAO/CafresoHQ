# The Office as Interface — design system for the non-guru

> **Status:** Design doc · 2026-08-05 · implements North Star §3.2/§3.6
> (`strategy/08-north-star-real-product.md`).
> **Builds on** `OFFICE_REVAMP.md` (the continuous floor) and `LIVING_FLOOR.md`
> (desktop mode) — those cover how the office *renders*; this covers how it
> *teaches*. Scope: the metaphor as onboarding + UX for people who will never
> open a terminal, and the copy/animation rules that keep it honest.

## 1. The principle: the metaphor does the teaching

Every AI concept a newcomer finds alien gets a physical counterpart they
already understand from any workplace. We never *explain* the concept; the
office layout and the coworkers' behavior demonstrate it. This is the whole
accessibility strategy — not tooltips, not a tutorial video.

| AI concept | Office counterpart | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Model / agent runtime | **A coworker** with visible strengths | roster + floor |
| Connecting a backend / auth | **Hiring** ("we found your Claude subscription — want them on the team?") | front desk |
| System prompt / persona | **Job description** (editable, plain language) | coworker card |
| Context / workspace dir | **Their desk** — what's on it is what they know | desk view |
| Multi-agent planning | **The meeting room** (already a floor destination) | meeting table |
| E2E vault | **The filing cabinet** — visibly locked; only you have the key | vault |
| Scheduled missions / night_runner | **The Night Shift board** (bulletin board) | missions |
| Tool-use approval | **Coworker walks to YOUR desk and asks** | approval flow |
| Logs / traces | **Watching them work** (animation = trace viewer) | floor |
| Tokens / usage / cost | **Payroll** | payroll ledger |
| Artifacts / outputs | **The out-tray**, filed to the cabinet | desk → vault |
| Model catalog / marketplace (Phase C) | **The hiring pool** — candidates with résumés | hiring board |

**Rule:** if a feature can't be mapped to something in a real office, that's a
smell it doesn't belong in the newcomer path (it may still belong behind the
Living Floor's desktop-mode door for power users).

## 2. The cast

Coworkers are the product's characters — the roster mechanic (a team of
distinct helpers with different strengths, collect the ones you need) is what
makes model-agnosticism *legible*. Each hireable coworker gets a card:

- **Sprite + name** — ours, consistent with the existing 16×16 office art.
  The vendor appears as a small, honest "powered by Claude / Gemini / GPT /
  local GPU" chip — never as the coworker's identity. (Vendors change; your
  coworker persists. This also keeps rebadging drivers trivial.)
- **Stat bars (4, no more):** Speed · Depth · Code · Cost. Derived from the
  driver manifest's costHint + model class; honest and relative, not
  benchmark cosplay.
- **Specialty tag:** one line ("great with research briefs", "ships small
  sites", "cheap and tireless" for local models).
- **Job description:** the persona, in plain prose, editable in place. This IS
  the system prompt — we just never call it that.
- **Experience:** jobs completed, current streak (see §5).

Tone guardrails: **corporate HQ with heart** — warm, professional, a little
playful. Not childish, no baby-talk, no fake enthusiasm in copy. The office is
charming; the coworkers are competent.

## 3. First run — five minutes to first delight

The protected front door (North Star §3.6). No settings pages, no model IDs,
no keys pasted in this path.

1. **Walk in.** The front desk greets you; behind it, the office floor is
   visibly alive (trial brain doing ambient work). One sentence of promise, no
   feature tour.
2. **"Here's who we can hire today."** Driver `detect()` runs (existing
   `_agent_auth_detect` machinery): found subscriptions/CLIs/local daemons
   appear as candidates — *"We found your Claude subscription"*. Nothing
   found → the trial brain is already at a desk, pre-hired.
3. **Hire one.** One click; the sprite walks in, sits at a desk. (First
   micro-delight — target < 60 seconds from landing.)
4. **Pick a starter task.** Three cards, real outcomes, zero blank-prompt
   anxiety: *Research brief* ("give me a sourced brief on X") · *Digest*
   ("summarize these files into my vault") · *Small site* ("make me a simple
   page for X"). Free-text exists but is not the star.
5. **Watch the work.** The animation layer (§4) plays the task honestly.
   If the task needs a permission, the coworker walks over and asks — the
   user's first approval is diegetic, not a modal ambush.
6. **The artifact lands.** Out-tray → filing cabinet, with a share/open sheet.
   *"That's your first delivery. The cabinet is encrypted — only you can open
   it."* First delight + the trust story in one beat.

Exit test (from the North Star): a non-developer stranger completes this
unaided in under five minutes.

## 4. Show-the-work: event → animation mapping

The driver contract's event stream (`DRIVER_CONTRACT.md` §1.3) is the
animation API. One mapping, every backend, including future hired network
agents:

| event | sprite behavior |
|---|---|
| `status: thinking` | sits, thought bubble |
| `token` | typing at the desk (monitor glow) |
| `tool_call` (auto-approved) | walks to the relevant prop — cabinet = file read, bookshelf = Library/search, phone = web fetch |
| `tool_call` (needs approval) | **walks to the user's desk, waits with a speech bubble** |
| `tool_result` | returns to desk |
| `artifact` | carries a document to the out-tray |
| `usage` | (silent — feeds payroll) |
| `error` | scratches head, "hit a snag" bubble with one honest sentence |
| `done` | stretches, files the result, back to idle |

Rules: animations must be **honest** (never play "working" when the driver is
erroring), **interruptible** (a tap on the sprite opens the live task detail
for anyone who does want the text stream), and **cheap** (reuse the existing
walker/commute system from `OFFICE_REVAMP.md`; no per-event new tech).

## 5. Experience & the résumé (Phase B → C bridge)

Each completed task increments the coworker's visible experience: jobs
completed, streaks, specialty affinity ("12 research briefs"). Phase B value:
attachment and legibility ("Mira's done all my briefs"). Phase C value: the
same numbers become the **on-chain résumé ledger** for marketplace agents —
jobs completed, re-hire rate, disputes — the trust signal that makes hiring a
stranger's agent feel like reading a CV instead of gambling on a GPU. Design
the XP counters now with that continuity in mind (per-agent, per-task-type,
append-only).

## 6. Jargon translation table (binding for all UI copy)

| Never say | Say |
|---|---|
| system prompt | job description |
| context window | memory span ("what fits on their desk") |
| tokens / usage | work done · payroll |
| model (as a selector) | coworker |
| temperature | (hidden; "creativity" dial behind Advanced if ever) |
| API key / OAuth | subscription / sign-in |
| agent runtime / backend / driver | (internal words — users see coworkers) |
| tool call | (shown as the action itself: "reading files", "searching") |
| inference / completion | working / answer |

Raw model IDs, JSON, and driver names may appear in desktop-mode surfaces and
settings — never on the floor, the cards, or onboarding.

## 7. What newcomers never see

- A terminal (Living Floor desktop mode keeps it, behind the door).
- A blank prompt box as the primary call to action.
- Vendor logos as coworker identities.
- Settings as a prerequisite to the first task.
- Raw error dumps — every failure is one honest sentence plus "try again /
  ask differently / pick another coworker."
